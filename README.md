# Tap-O-Matic DDV

The Olivia Artz Modular Time Machine, version by Harry Richardson, modified by Blue Nautilus and the DivKid Discord. 

This version modifies the [Tap-O-Matic version](https://github.com/cormallen/tap-o-matic) by HR in two ways:
<ul>
<li>It moves the pan pots down by 2mm. This makes the build much easier since the pan pots don't butt up against the sliders.</li>
<li>It moves the power header on the back so that it doesn't interfere with one of the jacks. This means you don't have to shave plastic off the jack.</li>
</ul>


## Front Panel

All of the files for producing the panels are in the panel folder. This panel was fabricated by http://pcbway.com. It's a PCB panel using matte black solder mask:
